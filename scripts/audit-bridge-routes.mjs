// Follows every /panel-bridge/* REST route to the bridge action(s) it sends,

//
// HONEST CEILING (audit-bridge-routes-blind-to-the-passthrough, 2026-08-31
// bug hunt): the generic passthrough route (POST /command,
// server/routes/panelBridge.js) dispatches via `bridge.sendCommand(action,
// args)` where `action` is a runtime request-body variable, not a string
// literal -- structurally invisible to a literal-string regex, by
// construction, forever. This script used to just silently drop that one
// call site from BOTH its numerator and its denominator: `MISMATCHES: 0`
// printed as if the check were complete, while the route that can reach
// ANY of the ~102 Lua handlers (not just the ~34 named-route ones) had zero
// coverage. That is the exact failure class this whole hunt kept finding --
// "checked actions: 4" sat directly above "MISMATCHES: none" in this
// script's own sibling (audit-bridge-actions.mjs) and nobody compared 4
// against 21. The fix here is the same rule stated twice: (1) report what
// cannot be verified, loudly, never just omit it; (2) then extend real
// coverage where the code makes that possible -- BRIDGE_ACTION_CAPABILITY
// (panelBridge.js) is a closed, named allowlist of exactly the actions this
// codebase bothered to give elevated/replacement gating, and unlike the
// passthrough's fully-dynamic `action` variable, its keys ARE literal and
// checkable. Order matters: (1) alone leaves this honest; (2) alone would
// leave it silently narrow again the same way it just was.
//
// This is still not "every action reachable through the app" -- any of the
// ~85 Lua handlers NOT named in BRIDGE_ACTION_CAPABILITY is technically
// reachable through the passthrough by any role holding plain
// bridge.command, and nothing here (or anywhere else, as of this fix)
// checks THOSE against the Lua handler set. Said explicitly in the output
// below rather than implied by a clean-looking summary.
//
// Also removed: an `executeAction(` search pattern that matched zero real
// call sites in this codebase -- a pattern that can only ever match nothing
// is the same defect as a checker whose corpus went stale, just caught
// before it ever had a false green to give. If a future refactor
// reintroduces a differently-named dispatch function, this script needs a
// new pattern for it, the same as it would need updating for any other
// structural change -- kept simple rather than guarding against a dispatch
// shape that has never existed here.
