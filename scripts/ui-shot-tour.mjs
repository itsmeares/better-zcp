// ui-shot-tour.mjs — the standard way to look at what you just built.
//
// THE RULE THIS TOOL EXISTS TO SERVE (operator's own words): "when you build
// a new menu, take a screenshot and use impeccable to make the ui better."
// If you just shipped or changed a page, tab, or section: BUILD YOUR SCREEN,
// SHOOT IT, LOOK AT IT, FIX WHAT LOOKS WRONG, SHOOT IT AGAIN, THEN REPORT.
// That loop is the point -- everything below is just the plumbing for it.
// A rule that costs five minutes and a full-app build gets skipped because
// "this change is too small to bother." A rule that costs one command and
// ~30 seconds does not. That's why single-view mode below is the primary
// use of this script, not the full sweep -- reach for it mid-task, on the
// one screen you just built, not just as an end-of-night audit.
//
// USAGE
//   pnpm run ui:shot-tour                      # full sweep, every known view
//   pnpm run ui:shot-tour -- <name>             # ONE view -- the fast, primary path
//   pnpm run ui:shot-tour -- --list             # print every valid <name>
//
//   <name> is `page` or `page:tab`, matching this app's own routing/tabs --
//   e.g. `players` for the roster, `players:vitals` for the Vitals tab. Get
//   the name wrong (or leave it off with --list) and this prints the full
//   list instead of guessing -- see VIEWS below for the source of truth.
//
//   node scripts/ui-shot-tour.mjs [<name>] [--root <repoPath>] [--out <dir>] [--port <n>] [--keep-server]
//
//   --root   Repo to build/serve (must contain client/ and server/index.js).
//            Defaults to this script's own repo. Point this at a detached
//            git worktree to tour a specific commit without touching a
//            dirty working tree (`git worktree add --detach <path> <sha>`)
//            -- useful for an end-of-night full sweep when someone else's
//            change is mid-edit in the shared tree; not needed for the
//            normal single-view case of shooting your own clean checkout.
//   --out    Output directory for PNGs + manifest. Defaults to
//            <this repo>/.ui-tour/output (gitignored) -- NOT Screenshots/,
//            which is the tracked, hand-curated README gallery.
//   --port   Port for the throwaway server. Default 34917.
//   --keep-server   Don't kill the throwaway server on exit (debugging).
//            Spawned detached so it survives this script's own process
//            exiting, not just surviving the finally block's own
//            server.kill() call -- see spawnServer's own comment for why a
//            non-detached child dies with the parent on Windows regardless.
//            Its data dir is deliberately left on disk (the server needs
//            it); clean up both yourself when done (the script prints the
//            exact commands).
//
// WHAT THIS DOES (both modes)
//   1. Builds the client (`vite build`) against whatever repo root it's
//      pointed at (default: this script's own repo). Never `vite dev` --
//      a dev server's HMR would reload other in-flight edits mid-capture.
//   2. Spawns the REAL server (server/index.js) as a throwaway process: a
//      fresh temp data dir, a non-default port, and PANEL_NO_SUPERVISOR=1 --
//      it never touches this machine's real data/db.json or panel.lock. Its
//      demo server profile's RCON target is loopback port 1 (always closed)
//      on purpose -- see the comment in bootstrapAccount() for why that
//      specific port matters and what picking a "normal-looking" port
//      almost cost during this tool's own first run.
//   3. Creates a one-off admin account (via the real /api/auth/setup route,
//      using a per-run SETUP_TOKEN) and one demo server profile, so every
//      page renders its real authenticated content instead of a
//      login/setup screen.
//   4. Drives a real Chromium (Playwright) through the requested view(s) at
//      a desktop width and a narrow mobile width, in both themes -- one PNG
//      per view/viewport/theme combination.
//   5. Writes manifest.json + MANIFEST.md describing exactly what each file
//      shows, and tears the server + browser down.
//
// REQUIREMENTS
//   - `playwright` as a devDependency here (already added) with its
//     Chromium browser downloaded: `pnpm exec playwright install chromium`.
//   - Node with global fetch (Node 18+).
//   - Nothing else. No real Project Zomboid server, no real panel-bridge
//     mod connection, no auth setup ahead of time.
//
// A SETTLE CONDITION AND A RATE LIMITER COLLIDE (visual-sweep-2026-08-30,
// step 3) -- both are individually correct, and whoever next makes this
// tour dwell even longer per view needs to know why that can silently
// re-break the sweep. server/index.js:807 applies a real, production-
// necessary rate limit -- 300 req/min per IP, in scope for THAT file, not
// this one -- to every /api/ route, auth included. Once waitForSettle
// (below) started actually waiting for pages to finish loading instead of
// a blind fixed sleep, the run started spending more real time per view,
// which meant more of this tool's own polling/background-refresh requests
// landed inside any given rolling 60s window than before. Nothing about
// the settle condition or the limiter is wrong on its own; the combination
// crossed 300/min by the time a full sweep reached the settings tabs, worse
// on the mobile pass (runs second, inherits the first pass's window
// history). Fixed here, NOT in server/index.js -- that limiter is a
// production safety feature and out of scope to weaken for this tool's
// convenience. See paceForRateLimit below: it reads the RateLimit-Remaining
// / RateLimit-Reset headers express-rate-limit already sends
// (standardHeaders: true, draft-6) on every /api/ response and pauses for
// exactly as long as the server itself says is left, rather than a fixed
// guessed delay -- correct regardless of how many requests some future
// page or interact() step happens to fire.
//
// AN APP FEATURE COMMIT BROKE THIS TOOL'S OWN SELECTORS, AND THE BREAKAGE
// LOOKED LIKE AN APP BUG (visual-sweep-2026-08-30, quality-pass follow-up).
// This is the one worth remembering above the other two collisions in this
// header: those were this tool fighting the app's real, correct behavior
// (a production rate limit, an intentional page-enter fade); this one was
// the app and the tool actively agreeing with each other while still
// producing a wrong result. `getByRole('button', { name: X })` without
// `exact: true` is a case-insensitive SUBSTRING match. Adding a HelpTip
// (components/HelpTip.tsx) next to any control gives that control's row a
// SECOND button whose accessible name is "Help: <label>" -- and if X is (or
// is contained in) that label, the tour's locator for the REAL control now
// resolves to two elements. `.click()` on an ambiguous locator throws a
// strict-mode-violation error; every `.click(...).catch(() => {})` in this
// file (the norm here, since a missing/renamed control shouldn't take the
// whole view down) swallowed it silently. Concretely: the Kill button's row
// got a HelpTip labeled "Kill" (Players.tsx), so its trigger's accessible
// name became "Help: Kill" -- a substring match on this file's own
// `getByRole('button', { name: 'Kill' })` -- so the click that was supposed
// to open the typed-confirm dialog silently did nothing, in EVERY viewport/
// theme combo, for two full capture runs. Fixed by adding `exact: true`
// (below); audited every other `getByRole('button', ...)` name in this file
// against every HelpTip `label` in the app at the time of this fix and
// found no other collision -- but that audit is a snapshot, not a
// guarantee. THE UNDERLYING RISK IS STRUCTURAL AND STAYS: either roster
// (this file's named button/tab/option targets, or the app's HelpTip
// placements) can grow a new collision at any time. This WAS genuinely
// worth fixing, confirmed by reading killButton's own locale string
// (client/src/locales/en/players.json) rather than assumed -- but it was
// NOT the cause of the dimming/washed-out capture symptom multiple
// reviewers reported that same night: a follow-up run with this exact fix
// applied (plus the leaked-dialog and page-transition-fade fixes above,
// and 0 stray overlays / 0 not-settled in that run's own manifest) still
// showed players-notes washed out. Whatever is producing that symptom is
// still open as of this comment -- do not assume it is this file's fault
// just because the ordinal signature matches; it might not be a capture
// artifact at all. See the investigation notes in memory/hive history
// (quality-pass-2026-08-31) before proposing a fifth capture-side theory.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER (be honest about the gap, don't fabricate)
//   - Modal/dialog content (e.g. Scheduler's "Add Task" dialog, confirm
//     dialogs) and multi-step wizards (ServerSetup's install steps beyond
//     its landing view) are not opened. Static top-level views and the
//     tabs/sections listed in VIEWS below are covered; deep interactive
//     flows are not.
//   - Real map tile imagery on World Map: /api/map/resolve is mocked (so
//     the coordinate system and player dossier/markers work), but actual
//     tile PNGs are not faked -- there's no real tile cache, so the canvas
//     will look empty/gray under the markers. That's an honest gap, not a
//     broken feature.
//   - PanelBridge-only live data (zombie count, weather, game time, player
//     vitals, vehicle list) has no live game server to source it from, so
//     those specific endpoints are mocked with realistic canned fixtures
//     (lifted from this repo's own component tests, e.g.
//     Dashboard.zombieWorldStats.test.tsx) purely so the new UI actually
//     renders populated instead of an empty "not connected" state. Every
//     other endpoint is answered by the real server -- most pages show
//     real (if data-less) server responses, not mocks.
//   - `server-finder` is a known crash risk, not a mocked one: loading it
//     makes a real outbound Steam master-server DNS lookup + UDP query
//     (server/routes/serverFinder.js), which has thrown a synchronous,
//     uncaught exception in this environment and killed the whole
//     throwaway server process. That's a real gap in that route's own
//     error handling, unrelated to this tool and out of scope to fix here
//     -- see the comment on its VIEWS entry below. It's kept LAST in the
//     sweep so a crash there costs only that one view.
//   - Setup.tsx (the first-run "create an admin account" screen) is
//     structurally unreachable, not just unaddressed. It isn't a route --
//     App.tsx renders it as a full-screen conditional gated on `needsSetup`,
//     resolved once at boot and permanently false the instant an admin
//     account exists. bootstrapAccount() below creates that account as the
//     very first thing main() does after the server comes up, before any
//     view's interact() ever runs -- so under this script's current single-
//     shared-authenticated-session architecture, no page.goto or click
//     sequence can ever reach it again. Reaching it would need a genuinely
//     different execution mode: a separate browser context opened and
//     captured BEFORE bootstrapAccount() runs (scoped, not built, as
//     ui-tour-never-drives-interactive-state).
//
// BEFORE YOU SHIP A UI FIX (ui-tour-never-drives-interactive-state,
// 2026-08-31): this hunt found three real states -- a permission-denied
// EmptyState, a failed-load EmptyState, an RCON mid-command drop -- that
// sat unphotographed for the app's entire history, because nothing ever
// forced the question "does an existing view actually show this." Four
// checks, cheap enough to run every time:
//   1. Does an existing view already exercise the state your fix changes?
//      Open the actual PNG and look -- don't assume from the view's name.
//   2. If not, and the state needs an error/permission/failure response the
//      real server won't give you on demand: `beforeGoto` (see its own
//      comment in the capture loop) mocks a route before that view's one
//      navigation, for exactly this. Cheap to add; see the `settings:*` and
//      `console:rcon-*` views below for the pattern.
//   3. If the state is genuinely unreachable under this script's current
//      architecture (Setup.tsx is the one confirmed case so far -- see
//      above), that's a real boundary, not a missing interact() step --
//      document it here rather than silently dropping it or forcing a
//      workaround that doesn't actually capture the thing.
//   4. After adding or changing a view, RUN it (`node scripts/ui-shot-
//      tour.mjs -- <name>`) and open the PNG. A view that captures without
//      failing is not proof it captured the right thing.

// quality-pass-2026-08-31 follow-up: Debug's TabsList went flex-wrap ->

// orphaning a tab off the bottom of a narrow layout -- correct,
// operator-approved app behavior, not a bug (the scroll cue is deliberately
// visible at every width for exactly this). But Playwright's own
// auto-scroll-before-click only reaches an ANCESTOR's ordinary block/
// document scroll; it does not reach a sibling still off to the side inside
// its own horizontally-overflowing container. A real user scrolls the
// strip; this tool didn't, so `debug:worldmap` (the last of 9 tabs) sat
// outside the mobile viewport, and a bare `.click()` retried ~13 times
// reporting exactly "element is outside of the viewport" before timing out.
//

// this tool's own `getByRole('tab', ...)` and player-roster-item clicks are
// both locators that COULD live inside a horizontally- or vertically-
// scrolling container, and the next nowrap/overflow-auto region added

// wired-no-ui-2026-08-30 mobile-shot follow-up: page.screenshot({fullPage:
// true}) only expands to the OUTER page's own document bounds -- it has no
// way to know a page's real scrolling happens inside a nested overflow:auto
// element instead. This app's shell (client/src/components/Layout.tsx) puts
// EVERY page's content inside a single `<main id="main-content"
// class="... overflow-auto ...">`, and that element -- not <body> or
// <html> -- is the actual scroll container on every route. The tell, if you
// hit this again on some other app: document.body.scrollHeight equals
// window.innerHeight (the document itself never scrolls) while some
// descendant's own scrollHeight is much larger than its clientHeight.
// Confirmed the hard way on events:climate-trim at 390x844: the selected
// panel's own heading was already in the DOM at getBoundingClientRect().
// top=1164 -- past the fold -- before touching anything; setting
// mainEl.scrollTop = mainEl.scrollHeight (what a real scroll gesture does)
// moved it to top=147, fully visible, with the real content ("fog") now in
// document.body.innerText. The panel was never missing -- fullPage just
// never scrolled the container that actually holds it, on EVERY view this
// tool has ever captured on mobile, not just Events.
//
// Fix: immediately before the screenshot, override #main-content's overflow
// and height with inline styles so its content flows naturally into the
// page instead of scrolling inside its own box -- the outer document then
// grows to include all of it, which is exactly what fullPage needs. Restore
// the original inline style right after so the live page (and the next
// interact() step, if any) is untouched. Harmless when the container
// doesn't overflow: same content, same layout, just no scrollbar for an
// instant. Applied to every capture (both viewports), not just mobile --
// desktop pages fit today, but there's no guarantee that stays true, and
// this costs nothing when there's nothing to expand.
//
// mobile-full-pass-2026-08-30 follow-up -- the fix above has a WIDTH side
// effect that produced a false-positive "renders at desktop width" on every
// settings:* view, including settings:about, which has no fixed-width
// content of its own. #main-content is `flex-1` inside Layout.tsx's flex
// shell; with its normal `overflow-auto`, any value other than 'visible' on
// overflow-x/overflow-y resets that axis's *automatic minimum size* to 0,
// which is what lets a flex item shrink below its content's intrinsic
// (min-content) width in the first place. Flipping the whole `overflow`
// shorthand to 'visible' resets BOTH axes' automatic minimum size back to
// content-based -- so if any view has a horizontally-scrolling descendant
// with its own (perfectly correct) `overflow-x-auto` -- Settings' tab strip,
// 13 buttons wide, ~1280px unwrapped -- #main-content's own automatic
// min-width becomes that descendant's full min-content width, and the flex
// layout genuinely grows the box to 1280px. That's not a paint artifact:
// scrollWidth/clientWidth on #main-content itself become 1280 the instant
// this runs, so fullPage faithfully (and wrongly) captures a 1280px-wide
// mobile screenshot for a page a real 390px-viewport user never sees wider
// than 390px.
//
// The obvious-looking fix -- set only `overflow-y: visible`, leave
// overflow-x untouched -- does NOT work; verified empirically, not assumed.
// Per the CSS Overflow spec, if overflow-x and overflow-y disagree and
// exactly one of them is 'visible', the 'visible' one is *computed as
// 'auto'* instead. So `overflow-y: visible` next to an unset overflow-x
// (still 'auto' from the Tailwind class) silently becomes `overflow-y:
// auto` -- no different from doing nothing -- and the original vertical
// truncation comes right back (confirmed: docScrollHeight stayed pinned to
// the viewport height instead of growing to the real content height).
//
// What actually works: capture #main-content's current (correct, clipped)
// width BEFORE touching overflow, then pin it back with an explicit inline
// `width` at the same time overflow flips to 'visible'. An explicit width
// overrides the flex algorithm's content-based sizing outright, so the box
// can no longer grow to fit a wide descendant's min-content -- while height
// is still `auto`/`max-height: none` with overflow fully 'visible', so
// vertical content still flows out into the document exactly as before.
// Verified on both known repro cases: events:climate-trim (390x844) still
// reveals its full height (844 -> 1861), and settings:mods no longer
// balloons in either dimension (stays 390 wide; height now correctly
// reflects true 390px-wide wrapping -- 3236, MORE accurate than the old
// buggy capture's 2546, which undercounted height too because reflowing
// text into a false 1280px-wide box also shortens it).
// quality-pass-2026-08-31 round 3: expanding only #main-content itself left
// an adjacent, structurally identical gap one level deeper -- the same
// shape of miss as the two animation fixes right above this function (each
// closed one specific scope/timing gap while a sibling gap of the same
// class survived). Confirmed on chunks__desktop__survival.png: ChunkCleaner
// .tsx's "canvas" Card has its own fixed Tailwind height (`h-[24rem]
// min-h-[320px] sm:h-[30rem] lg:h-[36rem]` -- 36rem/576px at desktop width)
// wrapping an inner `h-full overflow-y-auto` content div for the "no saves
// found" panel. #main-content's own overflow/height were already
// 'visible'/'auto' -- nothing left to fix there -- but fullPage:true only
// ever grows the OUTER document; it has no way to reach into a nested
// element that is ITSELF still clipping its own content via a real
// scrollbar. Survival theme's real "no saves found" copy is long enough
// (an extra "TRY A COMMON LOCATION" section the shorter remote-disabled
// message in light theme never shows) to overflow that fixed-height Card,
// so it got clipped at exactly 576px + padding, not the 900px viewport --
// coincidentally close enough to the viewport height in this one case that
// the truncation read as "hit the viewport edge" until measured.
//
// Generalized rather than special-cased to this one Card: walk every
// descendant of #main-content and expand ANY element that is currently
// clipping its own content (scrollHeight meaningfully taller than
// clientHeight) the same way #main-content itself is expanded, marking
// each one via a data attribute so restoreMainAfterCapture can revert
// exactly the set this run actually touched. Trade-off, accepted
// deliberately: a page with a live, intentionally-bounded scroll region
// (a console/log panel, a long activity table) will now render its FULL
// content in the capture instead of a clipped viewport-sized window onto
// it. For a tool whose entire purpose is a human quality-review screenshot,
// showing more real content is strictly better than silently clipping some
// of it -- which is the exact failure mode this whole function exists to
// close, not a new one to reintroduce by special-casing only the one Card
// that happened to get caught this time.

// animation check (below) cannot catch this -- it runs BEFORE
// expandMainForCapture, so it settles on a page that hasn't been mutated
// yet and has no way to see an animation this function is about to cause.

// split reviewers saw was just where each shot happened to land inside the
// 300ms re-triggered fade, not a state that starts and persists.
//
// Fix, and why it isn't a wait: an early attempt waited for
// `.page-transition`'s OWN getAnimations() to go quiet (the same pattern
// waitForSettle already uses), positioned after expandMainForCapture
// instead of before. That fixed 4 of 6 views tested (players, moderation,
// vitals, spawn) but NOT Powers or Notes & Log -- both still captured
// dimmed even after the wait reported clean. Root cause of THAT: Powers
// and Notes each stagger their row elements in with their OWN separate
// `springFadeIn` animation per row (3 of them), and `el.getAnimations()`
// only returns animations targeting THAT element, not its descendants --
// so a `.page-transition`-scoped wait can correctly report "my own
// animation is done" while 3 child rows are still mid-fade underneath it.
// Waiting for the right thing in the wrong scope reports clean forever, so
// this doesn't wait at all: it forces every non-infinite animation on the

// (document.getAnimations(), not scoped to one element), right before the
// shot. Infinite/looping ones (compressHeader, brand-led-pulse, the
// connection-status `pulse` dot) throw on `.finish()` since they have no
// natural end state -- expected, caught per-animation, left running; they
// were never the problem (a permanently-running decorative pulse doesn't
// dim a screenshot, an animation caught mid-fade does). Deterministic

// visual-sweep-2026-08-30 follow-up: the tour used to capture after a fixed
// wait with no idea whether the page had actually finished loading. That
// missed a real failure mode -- a page that fires SEVERAL parallel mount
// fetches can be briefly interactive-looking between two of them (one
// spinner has already unmounted, the next hasn't mounted yet), so even a
// generous fixed sleep can land in that gap and capture something that
// LOOKS settled but isn't. Confirmed the hard way on this exact bug:
// Scheduler.tsx fires five API calls on mount and came out as a bare
// spinner in all four viewport/theme combos, which every reviewer
// (correctly) read as "identical across combos = not a timing race" --
// backwards. A fixed sleep against a fixed fetch produces the same wrong
// result every time; reproducibility distinguishes a race from a flake, not
// a bug from a too-short wait. god verified Scheduler.tsx:226 and
// Templates.tsx:48 both clear their loading flag from a `finally` (runs on
// success AND failure) and that a real failure path renders a distinct
// error alert -- absent from the shots -- before asking for this fix, so
// the pages themselves were never in question, only this script's timing.
//
// Three independent signals (a third, the page-enter CSS fade, was added
// after the first two shipped -- see its own inline comment below), chosen
// from what's ALREADY a real, load-bearing convention in this codebase
// rather than invented for this script:
//   - `[aria-busy="true"]` -- PageSkeleton (components/PageSkeleton.tsx)
//     puts this on its wrapping element for every one of its variants
//     (dashboard/list/form/console/map/default), and it's what a whole-page
//     initial-load skeleton looks like across this app.
//   - `.animate-spin` -- the Loader2/RefreshCw spinner icon used for every
//     in-flight async action this script's own grep could find (initial
//     loads, saves, refreshes, restores). Verified this actually matches
//     Scheduler's own spinner (`<Loader2 className="w-8 h-8 animate-spin
//     .../>`  at initialLoading) and Templates' (same pattern) before
//     relying on it.
// Deliberately NOT `.animate-pulse` alone -- Skeleton's own primitive uses
// it (components/ui/skeleton.tsx), but so does a live-connection status dot
// used as PERMANENT decor on Chat/Console/Events/WorldMap/Players/
// ServerConfig (a pulsing "connected" indicator that is never meant to
// stop). A bare `.animate-pulse` selector would never settle on any of
// those pages even once fully loaded. `aria-busy` already covers the one
// place Skeleton's animate-pulse actually signals "still loading" (the
// PageSkeleton wrapper), without inheriting its false positives.
//
// Requires the busy/spin signal to be ABSENT continuously for `quietMs`,
// not just absent at one poll -- a single instantaneous check is exactly
// what would fall into the gap between two parallel fetches described
// above. Polls rather than a single `waitForFunction` so the quiet window
// is actually re-verified, not just "was true once."

// visual-sweep-2026-08-30 defect 2: three agents independently reported a

// proven by ORDER rather than guessed: within one page's run of sub-views
// (e.g. players -> moderation -> vitals -> spawn -> powers -> notes ->
// kill-confirm), the dimming starts at some position and never recovers --
// a real page bug follows the PAGE, this followed the ORDINAL POSITION.
// This script never pressed Escape or closed a dialog anywhere, and a
// Radix Dialog/AlertDialog's Overlay+Content are portaled onto
// document.body -- outside whatever DOM subtree a client-side tab switch
// replaces -- so once something opens one, it can silently outlive
// everything after it in the same browser tab, across routes, not just
// sub-views. Ruled out as a REAL (non-tour) bug before writing this fix,
// not assumed: grepped for the actual banner behind the one confirmed
// correlation (a disk-space warning showing up alongside the scrim in
// several lanes) -- SystemHealthBanner.tsx renders a plain non-portaled
// <div>, no overlay, no z-index, no backdrop, so it cannot be the source
// for a real user either. The correlation was two symptoms of the same
// stale session, not one causing the other.
//
// Every Dialog/AlertDialog Content in this codebase (ui/dialog.tsx,
// ui/alert-dialog.tsx) is Radix's own primitive with no onEscapeKeyDown
// override that blocks it, so Escape is a safe, generic dismissal that
// doesn't need to know which specific dialog might be open -- this fix
// doesn't need to find (and isn't trying to find) whichever page actually
