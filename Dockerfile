# Zomboid Control Panel - Docker
# Multi-stage build: build client in stage 1, lean runtime in stage 2.
#
# Runtime uses Debian slim because SteamCMD requires glibc, Bash, and 32-bit
# libraries on amd64. On CentOS/RHEL hosts with SELinux, use `:z` on
# bind-mount volumes (already set in docker-compose.yml).
#
# IMPORTANT: This image runs the *panel*, not the Project Zomboid server.
# PZ runs separately (on the host or in another container). See docker-compose.yml
# for realistic topology examples.

# --- Build stage ---
# Pinned to $BUILDPLATFORM (the build host's native arch, not the target
# one): this stage only produces static client assets (client/dist — plain
# JS/CSS/HTML, no native binaries in the output), so there's nothing
# architecture-specific to gain from building it per-target. Without this
# pin, buildx runs dependency installation and `vite build` under QEMU for every non-native
# target platform (e.g. arm64 on GitHub's amd64 runners) — Rolldown/lightningcss's
# native binaries under emulation are dramatically slower and can hang for
# a very long time instead of the ~30s this takes natively.

# either -- so without this the bundle bakes in "unknown" while the backend reports the real
# sha, and the build-compatibility gate compares "unknown" against it and blocks the UI.
# Both halves must be given the same value or the check compares two different things.
