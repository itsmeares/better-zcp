// 2026-08-29, players.js moderation/GM-tools hunt: every pattern here MUST

// name cannot reach. classifyRconResponse() below runs an UNANCHORED
// .test() against the whole response, and PZ's SUCCESS messages for these
// same commands interpolate the target player's name -- kickuser's success
// is `User <name> kicked.`, setaccesslevel's is `<name> granted <level>
// access level on <server>`. A player who names themselves text containing
// a rejection fragment (e.g. "Not enough rights") would have their own
// SUCCESSFUL kick misclassified as a failure the instant that fragment
// appeared anywhere in the response -- including inside their own name.
// The three pre-existing non-anchored patterns below had this exact defect
// in shipped code; confirmed each one's PZ source is a bare, non-
// interpolated literal (no player name can ever appear inside "Wrong
// arguments!" or "Not enough rights" themselves), so anchoring them to the
// full trimmed string is a strict tightening, not a behavior change for
// any genuine rejection. Every new pattern added below is anchored the
// same way: full-string where the PZ text has no interpolation at all, or
// bounded by fixed text immediately before/after the interpolated portion
// where it does (e.g. `Invalid username "<name>"` is bounded by the
// literal quote+prefix before the name and the literal closing quote
// after it -- a success response's own fixed text can never coincidentally
// reproduce both boundaries regardless of what the name in between is).
//
// Sourced from server/__fixtures__/pzRconRejectionStrings.json (a
// decompiled catalog of the actual PZ B42 server jar's command classes,
// confirmed verbatim -- not guessed) except where noted otherwise.
