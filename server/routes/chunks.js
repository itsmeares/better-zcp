// on a 147,136-file synthetic fixture matching a real operator save, that
// pair alone went from 15.3s to ~5.6s once they shared one in-flight walk
// instead of each doing its own. /saves runs BEFORE that pair, sequentially
// (the client awaits fetchSaves() to completion before auto-selecting a
// save and firing /chunks+/stats) -- by the time /chunks+/stats start,
// /saves' own walk has already resolved and its in-flight entry is gone,
// so pure in-flight sharing can't bridge that gap. Nothing changes on disk
// during that gap either: it's the same page mount, no user action has
// happened yet. Measured full-mount-sequence cost of paying for that
// second walk anyway: /saves (~5-8s, see commit c67099f) then /chunks+
// /stats (~5.6s) again, back to back.
//
// So there are two layers here:
//  1. In-flight sharing (as before) for genuinely concurrent callers.

// invalidation is. Every write this file makes to a save's map/ directory
// (delete-chunks, delete-region) calls invalidateMapFolderScan() directly,
// so a chunk count is never stale after an action taken from this app's own
// chunk-deletion UI, which is the case that actually feeds a destructive
// decision (delete once, reload, see the old count, delete "again").
// The TTL exists for writers THIS FILE CANNOT SEE: server.js's /wipe
// recursively deletes map/ outright, and backupService.js's restoreBackup()
// extracts a full save over the existing one -- both mutate the same tree
// from a different module with no path to call into this one or be called
// back. Kept short deliberately: a stale read in the few seconds after
// either of those is a narrow accident of timing (the user would have to
// return to this exact save's chunk view within the TTL window), not a
