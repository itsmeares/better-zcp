// secrets; panelBridgeSftpPassword has no per-server counterpart and no
// single owning service (it's read directly off getAllSettings() by
// routes/panelBridge.js, routes/serverFiles.js and index.js alike), so its
// pair lives here instead of growing an RCON-scoped file to cover an
// unrelated credential.
//
// 2026-08-29: panelBridgeSftpPassword was the one settings-field credential
// that never got moved out to its own file the way discordBotToken,
// steamSessionId/steamLoginSecure and rconPassword all were -- db.json's
// own two backup paths (this file's createBackup() below, and the #122
// pre-update snapshot in panelUpdateChecker.js) both copy db.json as a raw
// file, so it was riding along in every one of those in plaintext.

 * upgrade. Guarded on the value already being absent: if an operator
 * restores an OLDER db.json that still has the plaintext, this leaves that
