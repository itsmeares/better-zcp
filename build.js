## First 10 Minutes

### Windows
1. Run Start.bat (double-click it — or double-click ZomboidControlPanel.exe directly).
2. Open your browser to http://localhost:3001
3. Create the admin account (first screen you'll see).
4. Open Servers and add your PZ server. You'll need the RCON port and
   password from the server's .ini (RCONPort=... / RCONPassword=...) and
   its install folder path — the panel can't discover these on its own.

### Linux (Ubuntu / Debian / CentOS Stream / Rocky)
1. In a terminal, in this folder: chmod +x start.sh ZomboidControlPanel
   (execute permissions usually survive tar xzf already — this is a safety net)
2. Run: ./start.sh
3. Open your browser to http://localhost:3001
4. Create the admin account.
5. Open Servers and add your PZ server (same RCON port/password/install-path
   info as the Windows step above).

That's it for a first run. Running this as a background service, behind a
firewall, or as a dedicated non-root user is covered in the fuller guide
named below — none of it is required just to see the panel working once.

## If It Doesn't Start

Three things stop most first launches:

- "Port 3001 is in use", or the panel silently starts on a different port —
  something else on this machine already has 3001. Check the console/log
  for which port it actually picked, or free up 3001 and restart.
- Linux "Permission denied" — the execute bit didn't survive extraction.
  Run: chmod +x ZomboidControlPanel start.sh
- Linux: nothing happens, or a glibc error — this binary needs glibc 2.28+
  (Ubuntu 20.04+, Debian 10+, CentOS Stream 8+, Rocky 8+). CentOS 7 (glibc
  2.17) is not supported — use Docker instead.

More symptoms and fixes, organized by what's actually on your screen: see
docs/install/troubleshooting.md — it's in this same folder, no internet
needed. (Path below.)

## Where To Go Next

This file only covers the first ten minutes. The fuller guides are right
here in this folder, so they work with no internet — and also live on
GitHub if you'd rather read them there or check for updates to them:

  docs/install/                                    (this folder, offline)
  https://github.com/itsmeares/better-zcp  (same guides, online)

- docs/install/windows.md         Windows: running at startup / as a service, firewall.
- docs/install/linux.md           Linux: the bundled systemd service, a non-root
                                   user, SteamCMD's 32-bit library requirements,
                                   firewall (ufw/firewalld), reverse proxies.
- docs/install/docker.md          Docker and Unraid — three setups depending on
                                   where Project Zomboid itself runs. Not needed
                                   for this package; only relevant if you'd
                                   rather switch to Docker instead.
- docs/install/hosted.md          Renting a PZ server from a host (Indifferent
                                   Broccoli and similar) instead of running it
                                   yourself.
- docs/install/troubleshooting.md Symptom-first fixes, organized by what's on
                                   your screen, not by subsystem.

For everything else — PanelBridge, updates, remote access, the full feature
list — see README.md in the GitHub repository (not shipped in this archive,
needs internet).

## Folder Structure
- ZomboidControlPanel.exe - Windows standalone binary
- ZomboidControlPanel      - Linux standalone binary
- Start.bat                - Windows launch script
- start.sh                 - Linux launch script
- zomboid-panel.service    - systemd unit file (Linux) — see docs/install/linux.md, in this folder
- install-linux-service.sh - explicit systemd installer; run with --enable to start the service
- docker-compose.install.yml - Docker Compose installer (published panel image)
- docs/install/            - Install guides for every platform (see Where To Go Next, above)
- client/dist/             - Web interface copy for manual upgrades and legacy installs
- data/db.json             - Configuration database (created on first run; NEVER overwrite when upgrading — see data/README.txt)
- data/db.example.json     - Reference db structure (safe to delete)
- data/README.txt          - Upgrade-safety notes for the data/ folder
- logs/                    - Application logs
- pz-mod/                  - PanelBridge server-side Lua (drop into Install/media/lua/server)
- checksums.txt            - SHA256 hashes for release archives
- release-manifest.json    - Build metadata for this package

The standalone binary embeds the matching web interface and can recover from
an older or missing client/dist folder. Keep client/dist when using the
journaled updater or a manual archive upgrade; it is still retained in the
package for compatibility with older binaries.

## Panel Bridge Setup (Optional)
The PanelBridge Lua enables advanced features like weather control. It is a
server-side drop-in, NOT a Workshop mod — there is no client component.
1. Copy pz-mod/PanelBridge/media/lua/server/PanelBridge.lua into your PZ
   dedicated server's install folder: Install/media/lua/server/PanelBridge.lua
2. Restart your PZ server (no .ini changes needed; nothing loads on clients)
3. Go to Settings in the panel and configure the Panel Bridge section

## Upgrading
- The panel auto-update feature handles upgrades safely — prefer it.
- For MANUAL upgrades, do NOT extract the archive over data/. Your db.json
  (admin account + all configs) lives there and the archive must not clobber
  it. Modern releases ship only data/db.example.json inside the archive, so
  a plain extract is safe; back up data/ first if you are unsure. See
  data/README.txt for tar/zip flags.
- If you ever lose db.json, check data/backups/ — the panel keeps the last
  5 auto-snapshots and will restore from the newest on next startup.

export function generateStartBat() {
  // Generate the Windows update supervisor. It swaps the executable and
  // frontend between panel runs, so the running process never replaces itself.
  //
  // The panel sets PANEL_SUPERVISOR_V=2, writes .update-pending, and exits
  // with code 75 when an update is ready. The supervisor validates the
  // journal and staged hashes, backs up the live files, activates both staged
  // artifacts, and records the operation in logs\\supervisor.log.
  //
  // A staged binary is selected only after its matching frontend is active.
  // Unexpected exits use bounded backoff and stop after MAX_RAPID_CRASHES;
  // MIN_STABLE_SECONDS resets the crash counter after a healthy run.
  //
  // Pending updates may be retried on the next full restart. Rollback of an
  // already-applied update is bounded by MAX_ROLLBACK_RETRIES because the
  // panel is down and repeating the same restore operation cannot recover a
  // missing backup. EXE_BACKUP_MADE and CLIENT_BACKUP_MADE distinguish a
  // backup that was never created from one that was lost during rollback.

=================================

This folder holds the panel's runtime state:

  db.json          Created automatically on first run. Contains your admin
                   account, server configurations, scheduled tasks, mod
                   tracking data, scheduled task history, and all settings.
                   DO NOT delete or overwrite this file — you will lose all
                   your configuration.

  backups/         Auto-rotating snapshots of db.json (every 6h, last 5 kept).
                   The panel will try to restore from the most recent backup
                   if db.json becomes corrupt.

  db.example.json  Reference structure only. Safe to delete.

UPGRADING THE PANEL
-------------------
When upgrading by extracting a release archive over your existing install,
make sure your archive tool does NOT overwrite \`data/db.json\` (or the
\`data/backups/\` folder). Modern releases ship only \`data/db.example.json\`
inside the archive precisely so a plain extract is safe — but if you are
restoring from an older release that contained a real \`db.json\`, exclude
the data/ folder from extraction.

Recommended safe-upgrade commands:

  Linux:   tar xzf release.tar.gz --exclude='data/db.json' --exclude='data/backups'
  Windows: extract everything EXCEPT the data/ folder, or back up data/ first.
