## First 10 Minutes

### Windows
1. Run Start.bat (double-click it — or double-click ZomboidControlPanel.exe directly).
2. Open your browser to http://localhost:3001
3. Create the admin account (first screen you'll see).
4. Open Servers and add your PZ server. You'll need the RCON port and
   password from the server's .ini (RCONPort=... / RCONPassword=...) and
   its install folder path — the panel can't discover these on its own.

### Linux (Ubuntu / Debian / CentOS Stream / Rocky)
1. In a terminal, in this folder: chmod +x start.sh ZomboidControlPanel
   (execute permissions usually survive tar xzf already — this is a safety net)
2. Run: ./start.sh
3. Open your browser to http://localhost:3001
4. Create the admin account.
5. Open Servers and add your PZ server (same RCON port/password/install-path
   info as the Windows step above).

That's it for a first run. Running this as a background service, behind a
firewall, or as a dedicated non-root user is covered in the fuller guide
named below — none of it is required just to see the panel working once.

## If It Doesn't Start

Three things stop most first launches:

- "Port 3001 is in use", or the panel silently starts on a different port —
  something else on this machine already has 3001. Check the console/log
  for which port it actually picked, or free up 3001 and restart.
- Linux "Permission denied" — the execute bit didn't survive extraction.
  Run: chmod +x ZomboidControlPanel start.sh
- Linux: nothing happens, or a glibc error — this binary needs glibc 2.28+
  (Ubuntu 20.04+, Debian 10+, CentOS Stream 8+, Rocky 8+). CentOS 7 (glibc
  2.17) is not supported — use Docker instead.

More symptoms and fixes, organized by what's actually on your screen: see
docs/install/troubleshooting.md — it's in this same folder, no internet
needed. (Path below.)

## Where To Go Next

This file only covers the first ten minutes. The fuller guides are right
here in this folder, so they work with no internet — and also live on
GitHub if you'd rather read them there or check for updates to them:

  docs/install/                                    (this folder, offline)
  https://github.com/fpsacha/zomboid-control-panel  (same guides, online)

- docs/install/windows.md         Windows: running at startup / as a service, firewall.
- docs/install/linux.md           Linux: the bundled systemd service, a non-root
                                   user, SteamCMD's 32-bit library requirements,
                                   firewall (ufw/firewalld), reverse proxies.
- docs/install/docker.md          Docker and Unraid — three setups depending on
                                   where Project Zomboid itself runs. Not needed
                                   for this package; only relevant if you'd
                                   rather switch to Docker instead.
- docs/install/hosted.md          Renting a PZ server from a host (Indifferent
                                   Broccoli and similar) instead of running it
                                   yourself.
- docs/install/troubleshooting.md Symptom-first fixes, organized by what's on
                                   your screen, not by subsystem.

For everything else — PanelBridge, updates, remote access, the full feature
list — see README.md in the GitHub repository (not shipped in this archive,
needs internet).

## Folder Structure
- ZomboidControlPanel.exe - Windows standalone binary
- ZomboidControlPanel      - Linux standalone binary
- Start.bat                - Windows launch script
- start.sh                 - Linux launch script
- zomboid-panel.service    - systemd unit file (Linux) — see docs/install/linux.md, in this folder
- install-linux-service.sh - explicit systemd installer; run with --enable to start the service
- docker-compose.install.yml - Docker Compose installer (published panel image)
- docs/install/            - Install guides for every platform (see Where To Go Next, above)
- client/dist/             - Web interface copy for manual upgrades and legacy installs
- data/db.json             - Configuration database (created on first run; NEVER overwrite when upgrading — see data/README.txt)
- data/db.example.json     - Reference db structure (safe to delete)
- data/README.txt          - Upgrade-safety notes for the data/ folder
- logs/                    - Application logs
- pz-mod/                  - PanelBridge server-side Lua (drop into Install/media/lua/server)
- checksums.txt            - SHA256 hashes for release archives
- release-manifest.json    - Build metadata for this package

The standalone binary embeds the matching web interface and can recover from
an older or missing client/dist folder. Keep client/dist when using the
journaled updater or a manual archive upgrade; it is still retained in the
package for compatibility with older binaries.

## Panel Bridge Setup (Optional)
The PanelBridge Lua enables advanced features like weather control. It is a
server-side drop-in, NOT a Workshop mod — there is no client component.
1. Copy pz-mod/PanelBridge/media/lua/server/PanelBridge.lua into your PZ
   dedicated server's install folder: Install/media/lua/server/PanelBridge.lua
2. Restart your PZ server (no .ini changes needed; nothing loads on clients)
3. Go to Settings in the panel and configure the Panel Bridge section

## Upgrading
- The panel auto-update feature handles upgrades safely — prefer it.
- For MANUAL upgrades, do NOT extract the archive over data/. Your db.json
  (admin account + all configs) lives there and the archive must not clobber
  it. Modern releases ship only data/db.example.json inside the archive, so
  a plain extract is safe; back up data/ first if you are unsure. See
  data/README.txt for tar/zip flags.
- If you ever lose db.json, check data/backups/ — the panel keeps the last
  5 auto-snapshots and will restore from the newest on next startup.

export function generateStartBat() {
  // Start.bat v2 — supervisor + applier.
  //
  // Why a supervisor instead of an in-process helper:
  //   The previous design spawned a detached cmd.exe helper from the panel
  //   right before exit, which had to wait for the panel PID to die, rename
  //   the staged exe into place, and respawn. That design was fragile on
  //   Windows for reasons that bit us repeatedly:
  //     - Defender / ASR silently killed the detached helper before it ran.
  //     - `start "" "panel.exe.new"` has no .new file association, hangs or
  //       no-ops depending on shell config.
  //     - TIME_WAIT on port 3001 made the staged exe fail to bind on restart.
  //     - UNC installs (\\host\share) had inconsistent SMB caching of the
  //       helper's writes.
  //   The supervisor sidesteps all of these by performing the rename BETWEEN
  //   panel runs, in a user-visible batch file the user already trusts.
  //
  // Protocol with the panel (server/services/panelUpdateChecker.js):
  //   1. Panel reads env var PANEL_SUPERVISOR_V=2 to know the supervisor is
  //      live, and uses the supervisor path instead of spawning a helper.
  //   2. When the user clicks "Apply", the panel writes
  //      ZomboidControlPanel.exe-dir\.update-pending  (a small JSON marker)
  //      and exits with code 75.
  //   3. This .bat sees exit 75 OR sees .update-pending and performs the
  //      apply: back up the running .exe and client/dist, activate both staged
  //      artifacts, and retain both backups until the new listener acknowledges.
  //   4. All apply events are logged to logs\supervisor.log for diagnostics.
  //
  // A staged binary is never selected by mtime alone. It is launched only
  // after the matching frontend has been activated by the journaled apply.
  //
  // Crash-loop protection: any exit code other than 0 (clean shutdown) or 75
  // (update requested), with no update marker present, is treated as a crash
  // and relaunched with backoff, up to MAX_RAPID_CRASHES attempts. Past the
  // cap this falls through to the same "stop and show the operator the exit
  // code" behavior every non-zero exit used to have unconditionally -- a
  // real boot loop must still surface itself, not spin forever quietly. A
  // run that stays up at least MIN_STABLE_SECONDS resets the counter, so one
  // crash after hours of uptime is never treated as part of a boot loop. All
  // three tunables are overridable via environment variable (used by
  // server/tests/supervisor-restart.test.js to keep the test fast).
  //
  // Rollback-retry protection (2026-09-04, god's design review of Angela's
  // :rollback_update proposal): a stuck .update-pending and a stuck
  // .update-applying are NOT the same risk and must not get the same
  // treatment. .update-pending re-triggers a fresh :apply_update on the next
  // restart (run_loop's own `if exist MARKER` check below) -- a genuinely
  // different attempt each time, against possibly-changed external
  // conditions (an AV scan finishing, OneDrive releasing a lock), naturally
  // rate-limited to once per restart, a human-paced action. Retention here
  // is deliberately unbounded and untouched by this change -- Dwight proved
  // it rescues a real transient failure (a relaunch completed his pending
  // update once he released a file lock).
  //
  // .update-applying is different in kind, not just in which file survives.
  // It only exists once :apply_update has ALREADY succeeded and the new
  // binary has ALREADY been launched -- the swap is done, so there is
  // nothing left to retry there. If that binary never acknowledges startup,
  // the handshake check below calls :rollback_update to undo the swap; if
  // THAT also fails, retrying is not a fresh attempt at anything, it is the
  // identical file-restore operation run again against a state nothing has
  // changed about, at crash-loop cadence (every relaunch, seconds apart,
  // not every restart). Two of :rollback_update's three failure shapes
  // ("backup is missing") are permanent -- there is nothing to restore FROM,
  // ever -- and even the plausibly-transient third ("could not be removed" /
  // "could not be activated", the same held-lock class .update-pending's
  // retry can recover from) does not need more than one or two genuine
  // attempts. So: bounded at MAX_ROLLBACK_RETRIES, then halt rather than
  // loop -- and halting is strictly better than looping here, not merely
  // safer, because the panel is ALREADY down in this scenario (the new
  // binary never acknowledged startup); this is a choice between a visible
  // stop and an invisible loop, not between running and stopped. The halt
  // message names the same three files
  // (.update-pending/.update-applying/update-bundle.json) the panel's own
  // Settings.tsx rollback_failed hint already tells the operator to delete
  // by hand, because this is exactly the one case that hint cannot reach --
  // there is no running panel left to render it in.
  //
  // Rollback false-positive fix (2026-09-04, Dwight's finding): the inverse
  // defect from everything above -- the log says broken, the state is fine.
  // :rollback_update used to decide "was a backup made?" by asking only
  // whether %BIN_BACKUP% / %CLIENT_BACKUP% exist on disk. When the backup
  // MOVE step itself is what failed (a locked file inside client\\dist, an
  // AV scan holding a handle), no backup was ever created -- but the live
  // copy was never disturbed either, since a failed move leaves its source
  // in place. That is a completely safe state: nothing to restore, nothing
  // broken. The old code could not tell that apart from a genuinely lost
  // backup (one that existed and then vanished), so it reported the safe
  // case as "[rollback_failed] ... journal retained for recovery" -- an
  // operator reading that would reasonably believe their panel was damaged
  // when it was not. EXE_BACKUP_MADE / CLIENT_BACKUP_MADE below track
  // whether each backup step actually RAN and SUCCEEDED, set once per
  // :apply_update attempt, so :rollback_update can tell "nothing to
  // restore" apart from "backup missing" without weakening the genuine
  // failure path -- a real lost/corrupted backup still trips
  // [rollback_failed] exactly as before.

  rem main-is-red, 2026-09-05: on a clean, unprivileged GitHub windows-2022
  rem runner, Get-FileHash is not recognized at all -- Windows PowerShell
  rem 5.1's module autoload for it silently fails there (confirmed via a
  rem two-round diagnostic: round 1 logged [MISMATCH] with no detail; round
  rem 2 carried the actual/expected hashes or the exception text, and it
  rem came back "The term 'Get-FileHash' is not recognized...", 5/5 times,
  rem never once locally). That silent MISMATCH conflated "I computed a
  rem hash and it differs" with "I could not compute a hash at all" and
  rem stamped both [av_quarantine] -- a real user whose PowerShell can't
  rem load that module, or whose AV holds the staged file, would have every
  rem update refused forever with a label that blames corruption instead of
  rem environment. Fixed at the root by computing SHA256 via the .NET types
  rem directly ([System.Security.Cryptography.SHA256], File.ReadAllBytes)
  rem instead of the Get-FileHash cmdlet -- these are always available
  rem regardless of PSModulePath/autoload state, the same way ConvertFrom-
  rem Json above never had this problem. Still wrapped in try/catch: a
  rem locked/unreadable file is a real possibility this doesn't remove, and
  rem now reports UNVERIFIABLE with the actual exception text instead of
  rem being misread as MISMATCH. The exception message has its own parens

  rem journal.hashes.clientFiles map that looked like a ready-made answer is
  rem a *different* artifact (release-manifest.json, for GitHub releases,
  rem read by the release pipeline), never written into this runtime journal.
  rem journal.hashes.clientSha256 is a single combined hash over every staged
  rem client file (relative path + per-file sha256, ordinal-sorted, then
  rem hashed together) computed by stageUpdateBundle() (updateBundle.js) and
  rem verified there before every apply on Linux; this reproduces the exact
  rem same value on Windows, same posture as the binary. Per-file hashing
  rem uses the .NET SHA256 type directly rather than Get-FileHash, for the
  rem same reason the binary check above does now -- see its comment.
  rem main-is-red, 2026-09-05: the SECOND, genuine (not Get-FileHash-
  rem related) mismatch this raised on the same clean runner -- reproduced
  rem locally once the diagnostic showed a relative path missing its
  rem leading character ("ndex.html" instead of "index.html"). Cause:
  rem journal.paths.stagedClient can carry a trailing separator (confirmed
  rem by deliberately feeding one in a test), and Resolve-Path's .Path does
  rem NOT strip it -- so $root.Length was one character too long, and
  rem Substring($root.Length + 1) on Get-ChildItem's own FullName (which
  rem has no such redundant separator) cut one character too many.
  rem TrimEnd() on both possible separator characters closes this
  rem regardless of which form (or none) the journal path arrives in.
  rem main-is-red, 2026-09-05: a THIRD, still-genuine mismatch, once the
  rem trailing-separator fix above was already on the runner --
  rem journal.paths.stagedClient there resolved through Resolve-Path to an
  rem 8.3 SHORT NAME (C:\Users\RUNNER~1\... for the "runneradmin" account),
  rem while Get-ChildItem's own FullName for each child came back LONG-form
  rem -- $root ends up SHORTER than the prefix it's meant to strip, so
  rem Substring($root.Length + 1) cuts too FEW characters this time, and a
  rem fragment of the real directory name survives as a bogus leading path
  rem segment (observed: "st/index.html" instead of "index.html", the
  rem tail of "dist.new-test" leaking through). Never fires locally --
  rem dev machine temp paths have no short-name component to begin with,
  rem which is exactly why this is a REAL USER BUG and not a CI quirk: any
  rem install whose temp or install path has one (a username over 8
  rem characters, one with a space, a redirected TEMP under PROGRA~1) gets
  rem every update refused as [av_quarantine] forever, forever misreporting
  rem environment as corruption. Get-Item -LiteralPath, not Resolve-Path,
  rem for $root: it comes from the SAME FileSystemInfo family Get-ChildItem
  rem uses for its children, so both resolve to the same long/short form
  rem consistently instead of two different cmdlets independently choosing
  rem how to spell the same path. Defended further with a runtime check:
  rem if a child's FullName ever does not actually start with $root (this
  rem exact class of bug, or a future one nobody has found yet), that's an
  rem UNVERIFIABLE with both strings in the log, not a silently wrong
  rem relative path -- the assertion that would have turned every one of

  const dataReadme = `data/ — Panel runtime database
=================================

This folder holds the panel's runtime state:

  db.json          Created automatically on first run. Contains your admin
                   account, server configurations, scheduled tasks, mod
                   tracking data, scheduled task history, and all settings.
                   DO NOT delete or overwrite this file — you will lose all
                   your configuration.

  backups/         Auto-rotating snapshots of db.json (every 6h, last 5 kept).
                   The panel will try to restore from the most recent backup
                   if db.json becomes corrupt.

  db.example.json  Reference structure only. Safe to delete.

UPGRADING THE PANEL
-------------------
When upgrading by extracting a release archive over your existing install,
make sure your archive tool does NOT overwrite \`data/db.json\` (or the
\`data/backups/\` folder). Modern releases ship only \`data/db.example.json\`
inside the archive precisely so a plain extract is safe — but if you are
restoring from an older release that contained a real \`db.json\`, exclude
the data/ folder from extraction.

Recommended safe-upgrade commands:

  Linux:   tar xzf release.tar.gz --exclude='data/db.json' --exclude='data/backups'
  Windows: extract everything EXCEPT the data/ folder, or back up data/ first.
