/**
 * Single source of truth for every machine-readable `progressCode` a
 * Socket.IO install/SteamCMD progress event carries. Sibling registry to
 * ErrorCode (apps/panel-server/utils/errorCodes.js) but deliberately NOT the same
 * file or field name -- these travel over steamcmd:status, install:log,
 * install:complete, steam:start, steam:log and steamcmd:complete, not
 * res.json() error bodies, and `code` is already a reserved field name
 * there (errors.json/errorCodeRegistry.test.js). Field name on the wire is
 * `progressCode`, never `code`, so this registry's literals can never be
 * mistaken for -- or accidentally scanned by -- the ErrorCode machinery.
 *
 * Every emit site references a code as `ProgressCode.SOME_CODE` (member
 * access), never a bare string literal -- the same discipline errorCodes.js
 * documents for `code:`, enforced here by never writing the wire value as a
 * quoted string anywhere except inside this file. See
 * apps/panel-server/tests/progressCodeRegistry.test.js, which enforces this both ways:
 * every ProgressCode.* reference in server.js is registered here, every
 * entry here is both referenced in source AND has an en (and, transitively
 * via localeParity.test.ts, fr) entry in
 * apps/panel-client/src/locales/{en,fr}/installProgress.json.
 *
 * CONSTANT NAME === WIRE VALUE === LOCALE KEY, always, no exceptions --
 * unlike ErrorCode this registry has no pre-existing legacy wire values to
 * carry forward, so there was no reason to invent the split.
 *
 * THE 12 RAW SteamCMD STDOUT/STDERR PASSTHROUGH SITES DELIBERATELY HAVE NO
 * ENTRY HERE. They are not ours to translate -- they are SteamCMD's own
 * output, forwarded verbatim. They are routed through
 * emitRawSteamCmdLine() in apps/panel-server/routes/server.js, which emits
 * `{type, text}` with no `progressCode` field and no way to attach one --
 * structural, not a comment someone has to remember. A raw line can never
 * carry a progressCode; a line with a progressCode is never raw. See that
 * function's own comment for why this needs to be physically impossible
 * rather than documented (server.js:3026's history, 2026-08-22).
