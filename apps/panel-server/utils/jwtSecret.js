/**
 * The panel's JWT signing key, stored OUTSIDE db.json.
 *
 * db.json is copied wholesale by two backup paths (the automatic rotation
 * ring in database/init.js and the opt-in "include DB" game-backup zip in
 * backupService.js) — both copy it by literal filename, not a directory
 * sweep, so a signing key kept here instead never rides along in either.
 *
 * Precedence, matching the existing RCON_PASSWORD / STEAM_API_KEY pattern:
 *   1. JWT_SECRET / JWT_SECRET_FILE (readSecret) — an operator-pinned value,
 *      e.g. a Docker/K8s secret mount, or to share one key across multiple
 *      panel instances behind a load balancer.
 *   2. <dataDir>/jwt.secret — auto-generated once and persisted.
 *
 * A file that exists but can't be read or is empty is a hard startup
 * failure, not a trigger to mint a fresh key. Silently regenerating would
 * pass every health check while logging out the entire user base with
 * nothing in the log to explain why — see loadOrCreateJwtSecret below.
