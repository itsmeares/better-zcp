/**
 * Atomically write a file: write to a unique temp file in the same
 * directory, then rename into place. A plain `writeFileSync` truncates the
 * live file first, so a crash/power-loss mid-write (or, on Windows, another
 * process holding the file open) can leave a corrupt half-written config.
 * Writing to a temp file and renaming means the live file is only ever
 * replaced by a COMPLETE new version — a crash before the rename leaves the
 * original file untouched.
 *
 * The rename itself gets a small, bounded retry on a transient Windows
 * contention error (see TRANSIENT_RENAME_ERROR_CODES above) -- without it,
 * an antivirus scanner or the search indexer briefly holding the target
 * file open turns a perfectly fine save into a hard failure that a retry
 * 25-100ms later would have avoided. A non-transient error still fails on
 * the first attempt, no delay. Either way, the tmp file never survives a
 * failure: it's only ever cleaned up once, when this function is done
 * retrying and about to give up for good.
 *
 * Permissions (2026-08-29 Linux secrets regression): rename() makes the LIVE file
 * inherit the TEMP file's mode, not whatever the live file's mode was a
 * moment ago. A caller that doesn't pass an explicit `mode` (most of them —
 * this is shared by ~15 call sites across serverFiles.js/server.js/
 * serverManager.js/templateFiles.js, several of them rewriting server.ini,
 * which legitimately carries a plaintext RCONPassword= for the PZ server
 * binary itself to read) would otherwise silently RESET an already-hardened
 * file back to whatever the current process umask produces on every single
 * rewrite — confirmed on real Linux: a file hardened to 0600 came back
 * 0644/0664/0666 after one unmoded rewrite, depending on umask. Fixed by
 * preserving the existing target's mode across a mode-less rewrite,
 * intersected with whatever the umask-derived default would have been so a
 * rewrite can still TIGHTEN (a stricter umask than last time) but can never
 * LOOSEN. An explicit `mode` in `options` always wins outright, unchanged
 * from before. A brand-new file (no existing target) is unaffected — same
 * umask-derived default as always, so first-write behavior doesn't regress.
