// plain string sort of the whole filename put "-2.bak" before ".bak"
// ('-' < '.'), so within a same-millisecond collision group the
// chronologically-first (oldest) name was always treated as newest. But
// birthtime doesn't hold up on Linux for the same case it was meant to fix:
// several backups of the SAME filename created within the same JS tick (the
// exact scenario the collision suffix exists for) can land on ext4 with
// IDENTICAL birthtimeMs -- confirmed on real WSL2/ext4, not a theoretical
// concern -- at which point Array.prototype.sort's stability falls back to
// original array order, which is readdir()'s order, which has no
// relationship to creation order at all. The visible failure: the
// brand-new backup this very call just created gets treated as older than
// backups that existed before it, and can be the one pruned.
// See apps/panel-server/tests/configBackup.test.js's "pruning still keeps only the 10
// newest..." test, which reproduces this on Linux with no artificial delay
// between writes.
//
// The fix parses the timestamp + numeric collision suffix each backup's
// name already encodes (createBackup() below is the only writer of this
// format) and orders by that instead -- no filesystem timestamp of any
// kind, so no platform-dependent resolution to lose. Shared by
// createBackup()'s own pruning and by createBackupIfChanged()'s "is this
// actually new content" check below, so both agree on what "most recent"

// copies of an unchanged file and EVICTS the real, content-different
// human-edit backups that are the ones actually worth keeping -- the same
// shape as the sort-order pruner bug, just reached
