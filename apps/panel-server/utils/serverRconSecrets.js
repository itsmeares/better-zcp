/**
 * RCON passwords out of db.json, WITHOUT changing the in-memory data
 * model every other file in the codebase already reads and writes
 * (db.data.servers[].rconPassword, db.data.settings.rconPassword via
 * getSetting/setSetting).
 *
 * Unlike the JWT key or the Discord/Steam scalars, rconPassword is not a
 * single top-level setting — it's a field on every row of
 * db.data.servers[] (this panel manages multiple server profiles), plus a
 * duplicated mirror in db.data.settings for legacy pre-multi-server
 * installs. A sibling file (the JWT/Discord/Steam playbook) doesn't fit an
 * array of records. So instead of relocating the field itself — which
 * would mean rewriting every read/write site in routes/servers.js,
 * routes/server.js, services/rcon.js, services/serverManager.js,
 * routes/debug.js, routes/discovery.js and their ~40 existing tests, all
 * of which assume the field lives directly on the in-memory record — this
 * redacts ONLY at the disk-serialization boundary:
 *
 *   - redactRconSecretsForWrite() runs inside database/init.js's
 *     flushWrites(), right before JSON.stringify. It persists any
 *     in-memory rconPassword to its own file and returns a CLONE with
 *     those fields omitted for serialization. The real db.data object is
 *     never mutated — every existing reader keeps seeing rconPassword
 *     exactly as before, in memory.
 *   - rehydrateRconSecrets() runs once per load (every startup — NOT
 *     gated by schema version like runMigrations(), since db.json itself
 *     never carries these values once a single write has happened): fills
 *     in any server's rconPassword from its sibling file when the
 *     in-memory value is missing. A value that's still present (a
 *     pre-upgrade db.json, or any server not yet through a write cycle
 *     after upgrading) is left as-is — the very next write persists it to
 *     its own file and strips it from disk, so migration happens for free
 *     on the first write rather than needing a separate one-time step.
 *
 * db.data.settings.rconPassword (the legacy global mirror) is treated as
 * its own independent scalar via utils/uiSecretFile.js — same mechanism
 * as discordBotToken/steamSessionId — because some installs carry a
 * rconPassword in settings with NO corresponding server row at all (see
 * services/rcon.js loadConfig()'s "legacy settings" fallback), so it
 * can't simply be recomputed from an active server.
