/**
 * The single "is the active server observed running" verdict for whichever
 * server is currently active -- OR-combines the local process scan (or, for
 * docker-local/docker-managed providers, the container's own state instead
 * of the scan, since PZ runs as PID 1 of a *different* container there and
 * the local scan can never see it -- GH#114) with RCON and PanelBridge.
 *
 * 2026-09-01: this used to live ONLY as apps/panel-server/index.js's
 * getObservedServerRunning(), a closure over that module's own
 * serverManager/rconService/dockerClient instances -- which meant it could
 * only ever be called from index.js itself. apps/panel-server/services/discordBot.js
 * answered the identical question ("is the server up") at 6 separate call
 * sites (handleStatus, handlePlayers, handleStart, handleStop,
 * handleRestart, updatePlayerPresence) by reading
 * serverManager.getServerProcessDetails().running ALONE -- no RCON, no
 * bridge, no docker-provider branch -- because discordBot.js cannot import
 * index.js (index.js constructs DiscordBot, so the reverse import would be
 * circular) and had no other way to reach this logic. A split-container
 * deployment (panel and PZ each in their own container, GH#114's shape)
 * made every one of those 6 sites confidently wrong: the scan succeeds and
 * finds nothing (scanFailed: false, running: false) even while RCON is
 * genuinely connected, so Discord reported a confident "Offline" instead of
 * the "unknown" state it already knows how to render, and refused every
 * stop/restart command with "Server is not running" even though RCON could
 * have executed it. Pulled out here -- a leaf module with no import cycle
 * back to either caller -- so index.js's watchdog (checkServerStatusNow),
 * the dashboard badge (routes/serverStatus.js, via the same
 * resolveDockerHostSignal/resolveProvider this function also uses) and
 * discordBot.js all resolve the SAME question the SAME way, and cannot
 * drift out of agreement about the same server at the same moment the way
 * three independent re-implementations eventually would.
 *
 * @param {object} serverManager - the ServerManager instance to scan (must
 *   expose getServerProcessDetails()).
 * @param {{connected: boolean}} rconService - the RconService instance.
 * @param {object} [dockerClient] - explicit Docker client for the
 *   docker-local/docker-managed branch; omit to use managedContainer.js's
 *   shared instance (wired once at startup via setDockerClient()) -- the
 *   only reason index.js still passes its own is to keep this identical to
 *   the pre-refactor call for isServerObservedRunning's own test coverage.
 * @returns {Promise<boolean|null>} true/false, or null for "cannot tell"
 *   (failed scan, no other signal) -- render as unknown, never a confident
 *   "stopped".
