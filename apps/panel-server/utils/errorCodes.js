/**
 * Single source of truth for every machine-readable `code` the server
 * attaches to a response. A `code: "..."` value used anywhere in
 * apps/panel-server/routes or apps/panel-server/services MUST be a member of this object --
 * never a bare string literal at the call site, and never a locale key
 * built by concatenation/template at the point of use. That second pattern
 * is banned by name, not by guess: a sibling codebase (Zomboid_dev_panel
 * V2, apps/web/src/errorCodeMessageResolver.ts) shipped it as one of two
 * competing code->locale-key conventions, and the template-built one
 * "defeated three separate analyses" and rendered a raw i18next key on a
 * real screen because nothing had a static string to grep for. A key built
 * at runtime is invisible to every tool -- including the enforcement test
 * below -- that looks for a literal.
 *
 * See apps/panel-server/tests/errorCodeRegistry.test.js -- it AST-scans apps/panel-server/routes,
 * apps/panel-server/services, apps/panel-server/index.js and apps/panel-server/middleware for every
 * `code: "<literal>"` object-literal property and asserts each one is a
 * value here, and (once the file exists) that every key here has a
 * matching entry in apps/panel-client/src/locales/en/errors.json.
 *
 * CONSTANT NAME vs WIRE VALUE -- these are deliberately NOT always the
 * same string:
 *   - The 10 codes added most recently (auth.js, serverFiles.js,
 *     configMutationGuard.js) use the constant name as the wire value
 *     unchanged: ErrorCode.AUTH_REQUIRED === "AUTH_REQUIRED".
 *   - The 8 older codes (chunks.js, index.js, dockerUpdateProxy.js,
 *     panelUpdateChecker.js) ship a lower_snake_case wire value that
 *     client code already compares against with `===` today
 *     (apps/panel-client/src/pages/ChunkCleaner.tsx checks `err.code ===
 *     "server_running"`; apps/panel-client/src/pages/Settings.tsx checks
 *     `"apply_in_progress"`). Renaming those wire values would be a
 *     coordinated client+server change for zero user-visible benefit, and
 *     was explicitly ruled out (2026-08-22 i18n survey/ruling) rather than
 *     done silently. Their constant names are UPPER_SNAKE_CASE with a
 *     `_LEGACY` suffix, invented purely so every code -- old or new -- has
 *     an UPPER_SNAKE_CASE locale key to hang a translation on, even though
 *     the wire value itself stays frozen and lower_snake_case forever. Do
 *     not "clean up" a legacy wire value without going back to whoever
 *     owns the client comparison it would break.
 *
 * The constant name IS the locale key: apps/panel-client/src/locales/en/errors.json
 * and fr/errors.json key their entries by constant name
 * (`"AUTH_REQUIRED": "..."`, `"SERVER_RUNNING_LEGACY": "..."`), never by
 * wire value -- so a locale key is always derivable from the constant name
 * alone, independent of what the wire value happens to be.
