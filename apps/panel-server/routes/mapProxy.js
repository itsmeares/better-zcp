// ─── B42 map version resolution ──────────────────────────────────────────────
// b42map.com has migrated to pzmap.org. The old map.projectzomboid.com host
// now redirects there, adding another failure point for direct browser loads.
//
// pzmap.org split into two hosts: the site root and its build-list API stayed
// at pzmap.org, but tiles and every per-build descriptor under a version
// directory (map_info.json, layer0.dzi, base_top/layer0.dzi, and the tiles
// themselves) moved to tiles.pzmap.org AND dropped the /maps path segment:
//   old (404s now): https://pzmap.org/maps/<version>/base/layer<floor>_files/<level>/<tile>
//   new:            https://tiles.pzmap.org/<version>/base/layer<floor>_files/<level>/<tile>
//
// build_list.json (what this file used to fetch for the build list) is DEAD,
// not just blocked -- it's a genuine 404 on both hosts. pzmap.org's own
// current bundle (read directly out of its shipped JS) fetches
// GET pzmap.org/api/builds/default (the build pzmap.org itself is showing
// right now) and GET pzmap.org/api/builds (the full list, oldest-first --
// NOT newest-first, unlike the old build_list.json's assumed ordering) as a
// fallback when no entry is flagged default. See fetchBuildDefault() /
// fetchBuildList() below.
//
// Separately: every JSON/XML/HTML descriptor path this file needs on EITHER
// host (pzmap.org/api/builds*, tiles.pzmap.org/<dir>/base/layer0.dzi,
// .../map_info.json, .../base_top/layer0.dzi) is behind a Cloudflare
// bot-management challenge that blocks Node's own TLS stack outright --
// confirmed identically for both `fetch` and the `https` module, so this is
// not a fetch-vs-https question, it's every HTTP client built on Node's TLS
// stack. curl gets through this challenge far more reliably than either --
// confirmed independently by two of us, across every path on both hosts,
// many times over. Raw tile BYTES (.../layer<floor>_files/<level>/<tile>.jpg,
// what serveTile() below fetches) are NOT behind this rule for any client
// tested, including plain Node fetch -- that's why tile serving already
// works today even though discovery doesn't; don't route serveTile()'s
// per-tile hot path through curl, there's no need and spawning a process
// per tile would be a real perf regression.
//
// What curl's success does NOT depend on, despite an earlier theory here:
// a specific User-Agent string. We measured curl passing with a spoofed
// full browser UA, and separately passing with this file's own honest
// identifying UA below -- and, hours apart, saw one of those SAME requests
// briefly 403 for no header-shaped reason at all. Whatever gates these
// paths is probabilistic and/or IP- or time-scored, not a deterministic
// per-request rule we can satisfy by getting a header right. So:
// getB42Map() below treats every curl call as expected to occasionally (or
// even permanently, if the heuristic tightens) fail -- caches a good
// result, never caches a failure as if it were an answer, and always keeps
// the hardcoded fallback as a real last resort. Do not build logic here
// that assumes a successful resolve today predicts one tomorrow.

// that might get more scrutiny with no header at all -- see the header

// server-side disk/mem cache IS namespaced by dir (relPath includes it for
// the b42 routes). A long browser Cache-Control on an un-namespaced URL
// means: if the resolved build changes (getB42Map() re-resolves at most
// once per B42_DIR_TTL_MS, and does change over a PZ B42 beta's lifetime),
// a browser that already cached a tile under the old build keeps serving
// those bytes for the rest of the max-age window, silently mixed with
// freshly-fetched new-build tiles for other coordinates -- "the operator's
// browser keeps showing the old world" for tiles it had already visited.
// Bounded to the SAME freshness window as /resolve's own Cache-Control
// (below) rather than the previous 7 days, so a stale tile can never
// outlive the client's own belief about which build is current by more
// than an hour -- and a "miss" here is still served instantly from this
// file's own disk/mem cache (Tier 1/2 above), so shortening this does not
// reintroduce a real upstream round-trip on the common path.
//
// The version marker on that URL means the
// 1h bound above CAPS staleness, it doesn't eliminate it -- it exists only
// because the browser-facing URL for /tiles and /toptiles has no component
// identifying which resolved B42 build (getB42Dir()) produced the bytes.
// WorldMap.tsx and ChunkCleaner.tsx now append `?v=<resolvedB42Dir>` (see
// their own comments) once they know the current build, making the URL
// itself an accurate cache key -- two different builds are two different
// URLs, so a browser can never serve one build's bytes under a request
// meant for another. When a request carries that marker, the content is
// provably stable at that URL forever (a future build gets a new `v`, an
// old cached entry with a stale `v` simply stops being reachable, never
// gets revalidated-and-found-wrong), so it's safe to cache indefinitely.
// The SERVER never reads or validates the actual VALUE of `v` -- it's
// pure client-side cache-key bookkeeping; this file always resolves and
// serves whatever getB42Dir() says is current regardless of what a caller
// passed, so a caller with a stale `v` still gets fresh, correct bytes,
// just fetched under a URL string that no longer perfectly names them.
// Requests WITHOUT the marker (an old cached JS bundle from before this
// change, a direct/manual request, /b41tiles which has no dynamic
// resolution to version at all) keep the original bounded value -- the
// safe fallback for anything that hasn't opted into the accurate cache key.
