  // fire from an explicit human edit-and-save action, never from any
  // restart or the scheduled world-backup job. So the one event class most
  // likely to silently replace a config (an unattended restart, at 4am,
  // nobody watching) was also the one event class the config-backup net
  // never covered. This closes that gap at the one place that reaches
  // every restart trigger, using the existing createBackup() machinery
  // (via createBackupIfChanged() -- see its own comment for why "if
  // changed" specifically: an unconditional backup on every restart of a
  // server that restarts on a schedule would fill the keep-10 quota with
  // duplicate copies of unchanged content and evict the real,
  // content-different human-edit backups instead).
  //
  // Called once the old process is confirmed stopped and before the new
  // one starts -- config files are static in that window, on both the
  // managed-container and directly-spawned paths, so this runs
  // unconditionally regardless of which one this restart takes.
  // Deliberately best-effort: a backup failure must never block the
  // restart itself, matching every other pre-restart step in this
  // function (RCON verify, world save) that logs and continues rather
  // than throwing out of performRestart entirely for a housekeeping
  // failure -- except unlike those, a failed *backup* specifically isn't
  // even something to fail the restart FOR, since skipping it only means
  // this one restart isn't covered, not that the restart itself is unsafe.
  //
  // Resolves the config directory/filenames via candidateIniPaths() --
  // the SAME 4-way fallback ensureRconConfigured() uses (server.js), not
  // the single serverConfigPath-or-zomboidDataPath/Server guess this

  // most likely to have their real ini at one of the legacy locations are
  // exactly the ones the stale-launch-script defect (see
