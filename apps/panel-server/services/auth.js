/**
 * Authentication Service
 * Handles user registration, login, JWT tokens, and session management.
 *
 * Design:
 * - bcryptjs for password hashing (pure JS, compatible with pkg)
 * - JWT access tokens (short-lived, 15m) + refresh tokens (long-lived, 30d)
 * - Auto-login via refresh token stored in httpOnly cookie
 * - First-run setup creates the admin account
 * - JWT secret: JWT_SECRET / JWT_SECRET_FILE env override if set (an
 *   operator-pinned value, e.g. a Docker/K8s secret mount, or to share one
 *   key across multiple panel instances behind a load balancer), otherwise
 *   auto-generated once and persisted at <dataDir>/jwt.secret -- NOT in
 *   db.json. See utils/jwtSecret.js for why it moved out: db.json is
 *   copied wholesale by two backup paths (the automatic rotation ring and
 *   the opt-in "include DB" game-backup zip), so a signing key kept there
 *   would ride along in both.
 *
 * Access tokens are short-lived because logout revokes refresh sessions, not
 * already-issued access tokens. The client refreshes on 401, so the shorter
 * window does not interrupt active use.
 *
 * The signing key lives outside db.json because database backups copy that
 * file wholesale. See utils/jwtSecret.js for the file lifecycle.

// Confirmed live: an unauthenticated POST /api/auth/users with
// role:"admin" created a real admin account on a fully set-up install.
// /api/auth/oidc/status, /login and /callback are the ONLY OIDC paths in
// here — genuinely pre-session by design (the login screen checks status
// before auth exists; login/callback ARE the act of becoming authenticated)
// and neither uses requireRole/requirePermission. This used to be the
// whole `/api/auth/oidc/` prefix, exempted as a block on the reasoning that
// nothing under it would ever need a gate — that stopped being true the
// moment /settings and /test-connection were added (both authenticated,
// both requirePermission("panel.settings")): a blanket prefix exemption
// would have made them permanently unusable (req.user never set, so the
// gate always sees an absence and fails closed to 401) rather than

 * Express middleware factory — requires req.user.role to be one of the

 *
 * req.user.role is always the LIVE role from the database (see
 * authenticateAccessToken() above, which re-reads it on every request
 * rather than trusting the role embedded in the JWT at login time) — so a
 * role change via changeUserRole() takes effect on the user's very next
 * request, no re-login required.
 *
 * FAILS CLOSED: a missing req.user refuses (401), full stop — it does NOT
 * mean "auth disabled, let it through" the way it used to. That reading
 * used to be correct (middleware() genuinely never set req.user when auth
 * was off), right up until a route was added under a path middleware()
 * exempted from authentication ENTIRELY without also exempting it from
 * requireRole — at which point "no req.user" silently meant "nobody
 * checked" instead of "auth is off", and every requireRole-gated route on
 * that path admitted every request. middleware() now sets an explicit
 * req.user even when auth is disabled (see the authEnabled branch above),
 * so this function no longer needs — or trusts — an implicit meaning for
 * absence. A future exemption mistake now produces a locked door, not an
 * open one.
