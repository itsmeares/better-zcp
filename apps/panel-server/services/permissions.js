/**
 * Permission system: capabilities are the primitive, roles are named,
 * database-stored bundles of them. Replaces the hardcoded
 * requireRole("admin", "technician") role lists with requirePermission(
 * "capability.name") backed by the `roles` collection in database/init.js.
 *
 * CAPABILITIES is the catalogue every route-level requirePermission() call
 * and the matrix UI both draw from -- capability keys are load-bearing
 * wire values (apps/panel-server/routes/*.js reference them by string, and once the
 * matrix UI renders them, renaming one is a breaking change for whoever is
 * looking at it), so treat additions as append-only and renames as a
 * decision, not a refactor.
 *
 * DEFAULT_ROLE_CAPABILITIES is the migration seed (see database/init.js's
 * schema v2 migration) -- it is a SNAPSHOT of what every requireRole(...)
 * call site in the app actually granted at the moment this file was
 * written, not a policy choice. If a future requireRole call site's role
 * list and this file's seed ever disagree, the call site is the one that
 * changed; this seed only matters for the one-time migration of existing
 * installs and is not re-derived at runtime.

 * Express middleware factory. Unlike requireRole (a role-name check),

 * that falls through to next() on anything other than a confirmed grant:
 *   - capability not in the catalogue -> refuse (logged as a bug, not an
 *     access decision -- this should only happen from a typo at a call site)
 *   - req.user missing -> refuse (401). This used to pass through on the
 *     theory that authService.middleware() only ever left req.user unset
 *     when auth was intentionally off (setup pending / auth disabled),
 *     so there was nothing left to check. That precondition silently
 *     stopped being true for a whole URL prefix -- middleware() started
 *     exempting /api/auth/* from authentication entirely without also
 *     exempting it from this gate, so "no req.user" started meaning
 *     "nobody checked" instead of "auth is off", and every
 *     requirePermission-gated route under that prefix admitted every
 *     request. middleware() now sets an explicit req.user even when auth
 *     is disabled (see services/auth.js), so this function no longer
 *     needs -- or trusts -- an implicit meaning for absence.
 *   - no role row matches req.user.role -> refuse (role renamed/deleted
 *     out from under an active session)
 *   - role.capabilities is missing or not an array -> refuse
 *   - capability not present in role.capabilities -> refuse

/**
 * Rule 0: a seeded role (admin/technician/moderator) can never be deleted,
 * independent of member count -- this used to be enforced ONLY by
 * RolesPermissions.tsx disabling the delete button for isSeeded roles,
 * which meant a seeded role with zero current members (e.g. every admin
 * reassigned to a custom role first) could be deleted outright via a
 * direct DELETE /roles/:id call, requiring only roles.manage, not
 * users.manage -- the same "wipe out the ability to administer the panel"
 * catastrophe the recovery-lockout rules below exist to prevent, reached
 * by deleting the ROLE DEFINITION instead of removing its last manager's
 * membership. The guard belongs here, in the service every caller goes
 * through, not only in the one route or the one screen that happens to
 * call it today.
 *
 * Rule 3: refuse to delete a role with members unless reassignTo names
 * another role -- then every affected user is moved there first.
 * Rule 1 also applies here: deleting a role is a capability change to
 * "no capabilities" for its members, so the same recovery-capability
 * check runs against the reassignment target (or against nothing granted,
 * if there is no reassignTo and no members -- vacuously safe).
