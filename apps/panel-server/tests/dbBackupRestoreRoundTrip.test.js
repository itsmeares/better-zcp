// backup-restore-round-trip hunt (2026-09-05, god): "does a backup actually
// restore" had never been proven end to end with the REAL createBackup/
// createDatabaseBackup code paths and a REAL corruption+recovery cycle --
// every existing test either hand-crafted backup file content directly
// (dbCorruptionRecoveryFallsThroughBackupRing.test.js) or exercised
// runMigrations() in isolation against a plain object
// (rolesMigration.test.js), never both together through the real getDb()
// singleton. This file closes that gap, and the first test below is what
// found the real bug: createDatabaseBackup() copied whatever was CURRENTLY
// ON DISK, with no visibility into a pending debounced write.
//
// Per-file dataDir/config already comes from vitest.perFileDataDir.setup.mjs
// (global setupFiles) -- this file deliberately does NOT mint its own
// tempRoot the way dbCorruptionRecoveryFallsThroughBackupRing.test.js does,

// simulated restart (vi.resetModules() + re-import), not a fresh one per
