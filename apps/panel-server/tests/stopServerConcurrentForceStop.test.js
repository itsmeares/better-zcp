// Concurrency hunt 2026-08-29 (conversation hunt-wave5-2026-08-29). god's
// brief quoted Dashboard.tsx's own comment: "Stop/Force Stop have no
// server-side mutex, unlike Restart's restartInProgress flag." Confirmed by
// reading serverManager.js: startServer() checks BOTH `this._starting` and
// `this._stopping` before proceeding (throws "Server stop in progress, try
// again in a moment" / "Server start already in progress"), but stopServer()
// used to only ever SET `this._stopping = true` -- it never checked it at
// entry. So two overlapping stopServer(false) calls (two Force Stops, or a
// Force Stop racing the Docker/service-managed branch of a plain Stop) both
// proceeded past every guard: both scanned, both found the same PID, both
// called _killPids() with it -- redundant work, and on a real OS a second
// `kill -9` on an already-reaped PID is usually a silent no-op UNLESS that
// exact PID number has already been reused by an unrelated process in the
// interim (unconfirmed by necessity -- see the hunt report for why that
// couldn't be safely forced on this shared WSL kernel).
//
// FIXED by adding the same entry check startServer() already performs, one
// direction earlier: stopServer(false) now refuses immediately (before its
// first await, mirroring startServer()'s own guard) when `this._stopping`
// is already true, instead of racing a second scan+kill against whichever
// stop got there first.
