// linuxServiceLifecycleRealSystemd.test.js's sibling for the OpenRC provider.
// Every other test in this suite stubs execFile and never hands the
// generated content to a real init system -- exactly how the original
// directory=/command_args= word-splitting bug (a literal space in
// installPath breaking the supervised command outright) and the OpenRC
// command-injection bug ($(...) executing through openrc-run.sh's second,
// effectively unquoted re-evaluation of those two declarative variables)
// both shipped undetected. This file is the one place that is not allowed
// to stub it: it installs the generated init script into /etc/init.d/ and
// drives it through the real `rc-service`/`supervise-daemon` toolchain.
//
// Unlike `systemd-analyze verify`, OpenRC has no side-effect-free static
// verifier -- running this test for real ACTUALLY STARTS AND STOPS A
// SUPERVISED PROCESS AS ROOT under a real system service name. That is not
// something to run against a developer's real machine or a shared CI
// runner's real root. It is gated on both real OpenRC tooling AND root, and
// is written to be safe to run inside a disposable container (Alpine +
// `apk add openrc` is what this was built and verified against) -- it is
// NOT written to be safe anywhere else, and the skip banner below says so
// loudly rather than letting a quiet skipped-count bury that distinction.
//
// A second, container-specific trap: OpenRC's supervise-daemon forks a
// long-lived supervisor process that gets reparented to PID 1 on exit. A
// container whose PID 1 does not reap zombies (a bare `CMD ["sleep",
// "infinity"]`, with no `docker run --init`) leaves that supervisor as an
// unreaped zombie forever -- `rc-service stop` then hangs indefinitely
// polling for a PID that technically still exists. This was chased down
// live and confirmed to be a test-container artifact, not a product bug:
// the exact same generated script starts, respawns, and stops cleanly in
// well under a second once the container's PID 1 reaps properly. Every
// `execFileSync` below carries an explicit `timeout` so a host missing that
// reaping fails this test loudly and fast instead of hanging CI.
