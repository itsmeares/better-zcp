// Linux bug hunt 2026-08-29, suspect #3: getWorkshopPaths() (apps/panel-server/routes/mods.js)
// is the only place that searches a user's local Steam install for downloaded
// workshop content (used by dependency resolution and map-folder detection).
// It already covered ~/Steam, ~/.local/share/Steam and ~/.steam/steam, but not
// the Flatpak Steam sandbox root (~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/...), which
// is a real, common Linux Steam install shape distinct from all three. A mod
// downloaded only through a Flatpak Steam client was silently invisible to
// every function that calls getModDetailsFromWorkshop (missing-dependency
// resolution, map detection, conflict scanning) with no error -- it just
// looked like the mod was never downloaded.
