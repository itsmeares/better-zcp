// Concurrency hunt 2026-08-29 (conversation hunt-wave5-2026-08-29). god's
// brief named "an update-apply racing anything" as an angle to check.
// server.js's /wipe route (see wipeConcurrency.test.js, same describe-block
// style reused below) already fixed exactly this shape once: its own
// comment reads "Claim the guard before the first await: awaiting between
// the check and the assignment lets a second concurrent request pass the
// check and run a parallel destructive [operation]." backupService.js's
// restoreBackup() carries the identical fix with the identical reasoning
// (2026-08-27, see backupRestoreSafety.test.js).
//
// POST /server/steam-update (and /server/install, same shape) used to
// depart from that pattern: `hasActiveSteamOperation(normalizedPath)` was
// checked at server.js ~3641, but the actual claim --
// `activeSteamOperations.set(normalizedPath, ...)` -- didn't happen until
// ~3703, with a real `await saveAndResolveSteamCmdExe(steamcmdPath)` (which
// itself awaits `getSetting`/`setSetting`) sitting in between. Two
// steam-update requests for the SAME installPath arriving close together
// (a double-click, a retried request, two admin sessions) could both pass
// the check before either claimed, and both go on to spawn SteamCMD
// against the same install directory concurrently -- SteamCMD is not
// designed for two instances writing the same install dir at once
// (manifest lock contention, partial/interleaved file writes), so this was
// the "genuinely unsafe, not merely untidy" category god asked to
// identify, not the "untidy" one.
//
// FIXED by moving the check-and-claim block to AFTER
// saveAndResolveSteamCmdExe's await (and the two synchronous manifest-
// recovery try/catches that follow it) -- matching POST /install, whose
// own check-and-claim pair was ALREADY in the correct position the whole
// time (same helper, called before its own check). Nothing awaited now
// sits between the check and the claim in either route.
//
// Proven here through the REAL route handler (not a reimplementation),
// using the same "suspend one call inside its own async gap, let the other
// run to completion first" technique wipeConcurrency.test.js already
// established for the exact same defect shape in the same file.
