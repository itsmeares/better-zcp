// 2026-08-31 bug hunt (PanelBridge Lua mod + bridge protocol): tryResyncOutboxCursor
// (the results/outbox direction) was the one resync function in this file's
// three-way symmetric set that did NOT guard against moving its cursor
// BACKWARD. Its two siblings both do, and both say why in their own
// comments:
//   - PanelBridge.lua's tryResyncInboxCursor (commands direction, Lua side):
//     "A read of .queue-state-node.json that's stale or racing a second
//     writer ... can only ever show a LOWER panelHighWater than the truth,
//     never a fabricated higher one. Refusing to move lastCommandSeq
//     backward makes rewinding into already-processed commands structurally
//     impossible."
//   - tryResyncInboxCommandCursor (commands direction, Node side, this
//     file): "Forward-only: it only ever raises nextCommandSeq, never
//     lowers it, so it can't undo real in-flight work even if this read
//     races a moment where Lua's file is stale."
//
// tryResyncOutboxCursor (results direction, Node side) had no equivalent
// guard: if queue-state-lua.json's nextResultSeq was ever read as LOWER
// than what this process had already consumed (a stale/racing read over
// SFTP, or a freshly-regenerated state file), it would rewind
// lastConsumedResultSeq backward. pollQueueResults() would then re-walk
// every seq between the rewound point and where it actually was -- each
// one either already-cleared-but-undeleted (stalls ~1.5s per file in the
// empty-read retry path) or already deleted by cleanupOutboxFiles (stalls
// resyncStuckMs=20000ms per file, re-triggering this same check) -- while
// the bridge still reports itself connected, silently stalling every
// pending command's real response until that backlog fully re-drains.

// tryResyncOutboxCursor only proceeds past its own "have we been stuck at

// after outboxStuckState.nextCheckAt has passed -- mirrors the real caller

// a missing result file). Drive it through that gate explicitly rather than
// waiting on real wall-clock time.
