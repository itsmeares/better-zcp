// 2026-08-29 hunt (god): players.js moderation/GM-tools, suspects 1 (player
// name escaping into the command string) and 2 (does a failed RCON command
// look like success to the operator) turning out to be the SAME defect seen
// from two sides. classifyRconResponse() ran an UNANCHORED .test() against
// the whole trimmed response, and PZ's own SUCCESS messages for these exact
// commands interpolate the target player's name -- kickuser's success is
// "User <name> kicked.", setaccesslevel's is "<name> granted <level> access
// level on <server>". A player who names themselves text containing a
// rejection fragment (a real griefer move -- it's chosen BECAUSE it breaks
// tooling) made their own SUCCESSFUL command misclassify as a failure, for
// EVERY pattern in the array, old and new alike.
//
// This is the positive control: feeding only the real rejection strings
// proves the classifier fires; feeding a genuine success response whose
// interpolated name contains the same fragment proves it DISCRIMINATES.
// Testing only the first would be indistinguishable from a classifier that
// catches everything.
//
// New pattern sourcing: server/__fixtures__/pzRconRejectionStrings.json
// (decompiled PZ B42 server jar, build 24909800) -- KickUserCommand.class
// ("User X doesn't exist.", "This user can't be kicked."),
// GameServer.getPlayerByUserNameForCommand (shared by AddItemCommand,
// AddXPCommand, TeleportCommand, TeleportPlayerCommand, AddVehicleCommand,
// VoiceBanCommand: "No such user"), and GameServer.changeRole /
// SetAccessLevelCommand.class (four distinct setaccesslevel rejections).
// Automatically cross-checked against the same fixture by
// rconRejectionGroundTruth.test.js's drift gate -- this file only owns the
// discrimination property, not re-proving the strings are real.
