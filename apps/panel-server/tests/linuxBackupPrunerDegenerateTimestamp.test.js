// 2026-08-29, Linux regression (testing, "backups: the pruner still deletes the
// newest backup on Linux"): the pruner fix in 48de518/b8c288f sorted
// existing backups by real fs birthtime instead of the filename string, and
// that held up on Windows -- but on real Linux/ext4 (confirmed here via
// WSL2 Ubuntu, Node v24.19), several backups of the SAME file created
// within one JS tick can get IDENTICAL stats.birthtimeMs. When every
// candidate ties, Array.prototype.sort's stability falls back to the
// original array order -- readdir()'s order, which has no relationship to
// creation order -- and the brand-new backup this very call just created
// can be the one pruned instead of a genuinely older one.
//
// apps/panel-server/tests/configBackup.test.js's "pruning still keeps only the 10
// newest..." test already reproduces this for real on Linux (it seeds 9
// backups back-to-back with no delay, exactly the pattern that ties
// birthtimeMs there) -- see that file. This test pins the same root cause
// WITHOUT depending on real filesystem timing at all, so it stays a
// meaningful regression check on every platform (including Windows, where
// birthtime doesn't tie under this pattern and so never caught the bug in
// the first place): it forces the degenerate case directly by making every
// stat() call return the exact same timestamp, the worst case Linux can
// hand back, and asserts the pruner still gets the ordering right.
