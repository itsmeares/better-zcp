// Three ErrorCode entries are registered but deliberately never emitted --

// WRITABLE_PATH_{INSTALL,DATA}_{BAREMETAL,CONTAINER} and
// DIRECTORY_READ_FAILED_{WINDOWS,POSIX} respectively) because each covered
// multiple distinct English sentences behind an unreachable
// {{label}}/{{guidance}} placeholder that never actually received params.
// RCON_CONNECT_FAILED was split on 2026-08-26 into RCON_CONNECT_UNREACHABLE
// / RCON_CONNECT_AUTH_FAILED (apps/panel-server/routes/rcon.js POST /connect) because
// it collapsed "host never reachable" and "reachable, but the password is
// wrong" into one generic message, while POST /rcon/test already told the
// two apart -- see conv install-idiot-proofing-2026-08. The same day,
// apps/panel-server/routes/config.js POST /test-rcon picked up the identical split
// (it had the exact same collapsed-message bug and was never migrated when
// /connect was) and now emits the same two codes as a third call site.
// All three splits
// were additive-only: the original code stays registered, with its own
// explanatory comment at the registry entry (see apps/panel-server/utils/errorCodes.js)
// and its own apps/panel-client/src/locales/en/errors.json key, on purpose -- "kept
// for registry completeness," not an oversight. Verified 2026-08-26: none
// of the three appears as a literal or an ErrorCode.NAME reference anywhere
// in apps/panel-server/routes, apps/panel-server/services, apps/panel-server/middleware or apps/panel-server/index.js.

// exists) that every registered member has an English locale entry.
// A green run here proves a key EXISTS for every code -- it says nothing
// about whether the English or French TEXT at that key is the right text
// for that code. That last mile is the same one the locales README already
// names for the fr/en parity test (the shipped nav.items.serverSetup
// incident): a human has to read the rendered string, this test cannot.
//
// A CONSTRAINT THIS EXACT-MATCH CHECK IMPOSES ON errors.json: it compares
// each ErrorCode CONSTANT NAME to a locale key with `===`, so i18next's
// `_one`/`_other` plural-suffixed key convention (e.g. splitting
// ROLE_HAS_MEMBERS into ROLE_HAS_MEMBERS_one / ROLE_HAS_MEMBERS_other)
// fails this test -- the bare constant-name key it looks for is missing,
// even though a real, working pair of plural keys exists. Angela hit this
// for ROLE_HAS_MEMBERS and correctly kept the source text's manual
// "user(s)" style instead, documenting it as a constraint rather than
// fighting the test. This is intentional, not a gap to fix: exact-match is
// what makes this check catch a missing/misspelled key at all, and a
// looser match (prefix, or ignoring _one/_other suffixes) would let a
// genuinely missing bare key hide behind an unrelated plural pair. If a
// future code needs real plural forms, it needs a second, explicit
// mechanism -- not a loosening of this one.
