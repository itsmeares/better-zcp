// LINUX BUG HUNT (2026-08-29, card 560930): "does it handle LOG ROTATION --
// when PZ rotates a file, does the tail follow the new inode or keep reading
// a deleted one forever? On Windows a rotating process usually cannot even
// delete an open file; on Linux it can, and the tail keeps a live handle to
// nothing."
//
// Reading logTailer.js end to end first: it never uses fs.watch/inotify (the
// other named suspect) at all -- it's a plain 2s setTimeout poll loop, so the
// inotify-watch-limit concern doesn't apply here. It also never holds a
// persistent file handle across polls: checkChatLog()/checkConsoleLog() each
// do a fresh fs.promises.stat() by PATH and a fresh fs.createReadStream() per
// poll, and findLatestChatLog()/findLatestUserLog() re-scan the Logs/
// directory by mtime on every single poll. On paper this should already be
// immune to "keeps reading a deleted inode forever" -- there's no handle to
// go stale. This file PROVES that against real ext4 rather than trusting the
// reasoning: real file creation/deletion/truncation, real inode churn,
// real directory rescans.
//
// Must run from a REAL Linux filesystem (ext4) -- NOT /mnt/d, which is
// case-insensitive 9p with no real POSIX semantics and would give a false
// pass on anything inode-related.
