 * happened (a Docker container correctly shown running by the Docker panel
 * still read "down" on the same page, because the badge trusted the scan

/**
 * Composes Dashboard.tsx's host/RCON/bridge signals into the two booleans

 * process/container itself visible" signal -- correct for things that
 * specifically need the process, like the Connect-RCON retry action) and
 * `online` (the broader "is there ANY evidence this server is up" signal --
 * correct for Start-vs-Stop branch selection and for whether Stop/Force
 * Stop/Restart should be clickable at all).
 *
 * LIVE BUG THIS FIXES (2026-08-29, Discord report, Linux/native provider):
 * Stop/Force Stop/Restart were all stuck disabled while RCON was genuinely
 * connected. Root cause traced to apps/panel-server/services/serverManager.js:1661 --
 * getServerStatus() (the plain, legacy `/status` endpoint `status` here
 * comes from) and the composed-status route both derive `running` from the
 * exact SAME getServerProcessDetails() scan, so a Linux-side scan that can't
 * see the process makes `status.running` a definite boolean `false`, not
 * `null`/`undefined`. `online`'s PREVIOUS formula re-applied
 * `localProcessStatus ??` at its own outer level even though hostRunning
 * (one of the three OR'd terms one level in) already carries that same
 * preference for the host-only portion -- and `false ?? X` evaluates to
 * `false` in JS, never falling through to `X`. That silently defeated the
 * entire RCON/bridge fallback for any native-provider server whose plain
 * scan had ever returned a definite `false`, which is nearly always once it
 * responds at all. Fixed by only falling back to `localProcessStatus` when
 * composedStatus itself is unavailable -- when it IS available, `online` is
 * the genuine `hostRunning || rconConnected || bridgeActive` OR, matching
 * apps/panel-server/utils/serverStatusModel.js's own "any independent live signal
 * counts" philosophy on the server side (see performRestart()'s explicit
 * RCON fallback and stopServer()'s scanFailed pattern-kill fallback, both of
 * which already treat a connected RCON as sufficient evidence server-side --
 * this brought the client's OWN combined signal into line with what the
 * server already tolerates).

/**

 * verdict. Shares the same 3-signal composed-status interpretation Layout.tsx
 * and Dashboard.tsx use (host running / RCON connected / bridge active), but
 * returns boolean | null instead of a 4-state display string, and takes its
 * fetchers as parameters so it's testable without a real network or a
 * component render -- same shape as waitForServerState below.
 *
 * FAIL CLOSED, deliberately: null means "could not determine," and every
 * caller of this function must treat null the same as true (assume it might
 * be running), never the same as false. This function only returns false
 * when a signal source POSITIVELY reports stopped -- never on a fetch
 * failure, an indeterminate composed host signal, or no active server at
 * all. A guard whose safe path is reachable only by an exception isn't a
 * guard: the common failure mode here is the lookup SUCCEEDING with a
 * confidently wrong answer (a docker container's process invisible to a
 * local scan), not throwing.
