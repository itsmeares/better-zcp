 *
 * An exact ID always wins, checked case-sensitively first (the common case,

 * the actual mod ID are two independently-typed strings from two different
 * modders, and PZ itself treats mod IDs case-insensitively at load time --
 * see the case-sensitivity note below). Otherwise a mod whose ID is
 * `<required>_<suffix>` or `<required>-<suffix>` satisfies it: that is the
 * convention modders use when they ship a refactor, test or legacy fork of
 * the same mod from one workshop item. When several matches exist at the
 * same tier (case-insensitive exact, or fork), the one earliest in the list
 * wins so the result is deterministic.
 *
 * Both the load-order sort and the missing-dependency report use this, so the
 * two can never disagree about whether a requirement is met.
 *
 * CASE-SENSITIVITY: the exact-match and fork-match tiers must agree on
 * whether case matters, or a requirement can resolve against a same-mod
 * fork while failing against the literal same mod under a differently-cased
 * ID -- backwards, since the exact match is supposed to be the strictest
 * tier, not the least forgiving one. (Found 2026-08-31: requirement
 * `footprint` against an installed `Footprint` resolved to null/missing,
 * while the same requirement against `Footprint_Legacy` resolved fine --
 * see modLoadOrder.test.ts's case-sensitivity block.)
